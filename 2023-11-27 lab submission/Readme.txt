I have successfylly implemented the Progressive Web App and i have tested this in my localhost. As HTTP is the best way to test and deploy a PWA. and I have created  manifest.json,service-worker.json. and i have run in my localhost and upon opening Developers tools and in that Lighthouse tab we can analyse our code and generate a report that whether our code is a PWA or not. it gives a clear report that i have met all the requirements of a PWA and i got the scores to that and if everything is correct in the PWA report it gives that, ready to install your PWA. So in the code i am uploading the PWA report too. new version browser can install it easily. 

Successfully met all the requirements of the lab given.

Refer PWA report to understand clearly.
