											Week-3 Progress Report


--> In previous week, We have updated buttons like Insight, Features, About and functionalities to it. Further, when we click on Get Started, then Displays Login/Signup page with no functionalities given and with no user authentication.

--> In this week, we connected to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) as an instance to access cloud-based servers. Created an instance called MySQL. Then did all the required configurations and installations in local terminal. Ran Apache and MySQL. Got an IP address and linked all my files to the server through local terminal. So now my website is connected to a cloud based server and ready to store data in database. However, on running the IP address, there shows my website as i designget in week 2. now Login/Signup has functionalities when a user signup, it stores the user data in database and gives a pop-up message called Form submitted. Then that user if he Logs in, on Successful login it pops-up a message called Successfully Logged in. So, in this step User Authentication is done successfully. So, further on a successfull Login of a user, there creates a User profile of a User and Dashboard page is displayed. However the layouts,css,funtionalities will be discussed in the upcoming week's progress. 


--> Note: We ran the Amazon EC2 instance, as a basic trials, as it is very costly to run it continuos. For a basic development and exploring we get only 750 hours , and if we cross above that we get charged a lot. So, while running and testing , I am starting my instance state  and after the work is done we are stopping our instance. Meanwhile, I have taken all the neccessary snapshots of the required fields to show that user authentication is done successfully and data is stored in database successfully. So, if you run the IP address which is there in "db.php" you will get an "Error 404 NOT FOUND" since it is not connected to the server and the instance is in the stop state. 


-->Required Snapsots of the successfull signup and login also a snapshot od data stored in the database.
