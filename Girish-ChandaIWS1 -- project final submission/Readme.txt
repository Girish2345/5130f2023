Week-5 report


In this week, Have given funtionalities to the Dashboard button and when a user opens his profile and then when he modifies ( Add his expense ) in the expense form ,and add his income in the income form then , in the dashboard we get a graph, where all the total expenses, total income and total savings are calculated and displayed. SO, the graph changes dynamically as user makes changes.
