												Week-2 Progress Report


In the previous week we created a webpage and in that we cave a buttons named expense and we can record the expenses and the recorded ones will be displayed there itself. So this week I came up with a great progress in the webpage. Firstly, Added a best css for the webpage and made some arrangements in the webpage. Created some buttons called "Insight", " Features", "About". If we run the index.html, there runs the webpage. You can see the home page of the webpage, where we have buttons like Get started , on clicking Get started we see login/signup page. its just a login/signup page with no functionalities given. and you see a home icon which redirects you to the home webpage. However, there are buttons like Insight,Features, About. On clicking those buttons we can see the information of the particular button which describes the project. So, these insights,features and about button says that the Insights of the project and Features describes How Simplicity, Security, Detailed and Reiliable our project is and what we provide. And next comes About, it say's how Simple, intuitive and straight forward our project is.
