											Week-4 Progress Report


--> In previous week, a successful user-authentication/validation is done and data is stored in the database successfully.

-->Now for a Successful login of a user, Seperate user profile is created in database for the user and we get a welcome message : " welcome, GC!" and we have buttons named as "Expenses", "Incomes", "Logout". So in Expenses button, we have expenses form and user can fill it and the added record will displayed there itself and also stores in the database. Eventually, when diferent records are added,  total expenses is also changes accordingly. Also user can delete the particular record. and when he refreshes the page he can see the changes in the particular changes in the expenses section. and the data is stored in the data base successfully. Even the deleted record will also delete from the database . Samething happens with the incomes button too. Moreover, User can also logout .Then it redirects to the Login/Signup page. If a particular user logs in again with his details, he can see the data as it is. 

Next week progress we come up with some more intresting things.
