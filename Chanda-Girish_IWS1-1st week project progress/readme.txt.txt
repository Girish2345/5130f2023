In the provided HTML code, I integrated a simple yet functional front-end for an expense tracker web application titled "Coin Count". The interface features a welcoming description that outlines the purpose of the app, guiding users to manage their finances by logging and reviewing their expenses. Users are greeted with "Login" and "Signup" buttons, which lay the groundwork for future authentication implementation. Below, there's a form for inputting expense details, including the name and amount. Upon submission, expenses are added to a list displayed on the same page, allowing users to see a running tally of their entered expenses. The layout is styled with CSS for a clean and modern look, and media queries ensure the design is responsive across different devices. JavaScript is employed to handle the addition of expenses and dynamically update the list without the need for page reloads, although actual data persistence would require additional backend logic not included in this snippet.
